1.  Pre-Game Regulations:

    In Bounce, there is a twenty eight by twelve foot court. The court is split into two
    sides, each thirteen feet and ten and three quarters inches by twelve feet. To divide
    the court in two, there must be either a line or (preferably) a recess, the divider
    being two and a half inches wide. There is a home box (a rectangle), which is four
    feet away (the closest point is) from the center of the dividing line, and is two feet
    wide by one foot long. The area inside the court must be made of concrete or cement,
    and the ball must be a ball that is certified by a judge. The area outside of the
    court may be of a different color or of a different material, such as grass.
    
1.1 The players must be given the opportunity to decide which player will play on which
    side, and which player will serve first, if this decision can be reached in two or
    fewer minutes
1.2 The judge will decide which player will play on which side if the players fail to
    reach a decision    within two minutes, or if one of the players asks the judge to do
    so
1.3 If a judge assigns sides and/or decides who will serve first, that decision must be
    made randomly, for example by using random.org, asking the players to choose a number,
    flipping a coin, etc.

2. Serving: 

2.1 A serve is defined to be the action of throwing the ball into the area on the
    opponent's side that is completely in front of the home box, and no more than 3 feet
    away from a point on or in the home box while both the server and the reciever are in
    their respective home boxes
2.0 Servers must alternate after every point, but if thot unintentionally does not happen,
    there shall be no points replayed and the score shall remain unchanged
2.3 Any player that is not in his or her home box 5 seconds after the last point has
    ended, all disputes have been settled, and the ball has been brought back into the
    court and returned to the server will have one point deducted from his or her score
2.5 The server is allowed five seconds to begin the serve, meaning that the ball must be
    out of the server's hands by the time five seconds have passed, and if this doesn't
    happen, the point will be awarded to theo pponent
2.8 The serve must be redone if it touches the opponent’s foot before bouncing while the
    opponent’s foot is on the ground
2.9 If a player is holding the ball, he or she may not move around the court during a
    point other than to slow down after catching the ball
2.10If that happens, the player must move back to where they stood originally, but if
    this happens more than twice by the same player in one game, the point will be awarded
    to the opponent

3. Returning: 

3.1 Once a ball is received, it must be returned within three seconds of receiving it. Otherwise, the point will be awarded to the opponent
3.2 The ball must land on the opponent’s side
3.3 Articles 3.4-3.6 refer to where the ball would land relative to the opponent if the opponent did not move. If they are not followed, the point is awarded to the opponent
3.3 If the ball would land within two and a half feet of the opponent, it may be at any angle and bounce at any height
3.4 If the ball is aimed so that it would not land within two and a half feet of the 
    player, the ball must be going at no more of an angle than thirty degrees in either 
    direction (assuming that the line from player to player is zero degrees) and bounce at least four inches, as long as the ball 
    bounces at least two feet forward of the player
3.5 Otherwise, the ball must not be at an angle of more than twenty degrees and must bounce at least six inches
3.6 The ball must touch at least one of the hands of the player before returning to the 
    other side, but may not touch a player's hands more than five times before the ball is returned (each hand adds to the number of touches; a two handed catch counts as two catches). If this happens, the 
    opponent wins the point.
3.7 A return may be hit back instantly with(a “pingback”), but this may not happen by the 
    same player twice or more in a row. The point will be awarded to the opponent if this happens. pingbacks may not have more than one touch
3.8 If a return is caught without bouncing and then held for at least three seconds, the 
    player who catches the ball scores a point
3.9 After a ball is touched by the receiver, the ball will be in no matter where it 
    lands
3.10 The ball may not be touched when it is on your opponent's side
3.11 A player may not set foot on the opponent's side. The point will be awarded to the opponent if this happens. 
3.12 If a ball is not caught before the second bounce, the point is awarded to the opponent.
3.13 A bounce on the line does not count as a bounce.

4. Judging: 

4.1 A player decides that a rule was broken but the opponent disagrees, the judge will settle
    the dispute
4.2 The player who would benefit from the judge’s call may override it
4.4 If the judge was unsure about a violation, the point will be replayed.
4.5 To win the game, one player must have a score of at least twenty one that is also at 
    least two points ahead of the opponent’s score.
4.6 The term "The score required to win" means the score that the player with the higher score would be required to obtain in order to win, assuming that the opponent scores no more points
4.7 Bounce may be played with a predetermined rule where if the score required to win 
    reaches a predetermined number, either the player with the higher score wins or it is considered a 
    tie. 
4.8 A judge may overrule anything that stops the game from flowing smoothly.


6. Game Suspension:

6.1 A game must be suspended or paused if there is a safety concern
6.2 If the players are playing a point at the time of a safety pause, that point will be replayed and the 
    score will remain the same upon resuming
6.2 If a player wants to suspend the game for any reason, they must wait until a point is 
    over to ask for a pause, which automatically pauses the game until the request is granted or denied by 
    a judge
6.3 If the pause is for a bathroom break, it must be allowed
6.4 If the pause is for a water break, it must be allowed if the temperature is above 
    eighty five degrees and the game is being played outside
